## Quick Description
This script uses the VirusTotal API to scan a file for viruses. It prompts the user to enter the file path and then uploads the file to VirusTotal for scanning. If the scan is successful, the user is prompted to view the report. The script requires an API key from VirusTotal, which the user needs to provide before running the script. This is a simple and easy-to-use tool for anyone looking to scan a file for viruses

### Future Releases

Future releases will have the ability to scan entire directories or filesystems.
